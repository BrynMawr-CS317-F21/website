= Trigonometry anchor:trig[]

Consider the point *p* and angle stem:[\theta] below, where *p* is a distance of 1 unit from the origin and 
stem:[\theta] is 45 degrees. What is the coordinate of *p*? Hint: what are the values of a and b in terms of stem:[\theta]?

= Vectors anchor:vector[]

A *vector* is an n-tuple of real numbers. In this class, we will work with 2D, 3D, and 4D vectors.
Suppose we have a vector *u*=(-2, 3, 0)^T^ and *v*=(-1, 4, 0)^T^. 

* Draw the vectors *u* and *v*, with their tails anchored at the origin below.

Consider the polynomial stem:[p(t) = 9t^3 + 6t^2]. 

* What is the degree of stem:[p(t)]?

Let stem:[B_0(t) = (t - 1)^2] and stem:[B_1 = t - 2]. 

* Compute an expression for stem:[p(t) = B_0(t) + B_1(t)] and re-arrange the terms into standard form

NOTE: Standard form has the following pattern: stem:[a_nt^n + \ldots + a_2 t^2 + a t + a_0].
