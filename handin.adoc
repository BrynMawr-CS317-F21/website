= Hand-in your work

== What to hand-in

* Your code
* Images, movies, gifs, as appropriate
* Your readme

== How to hand-in

Check-in your code, images, and writeup and push the changes to Github.
If everything is uploaded correctly, you will see your work on Github.

[source]
----
> cd animation-toolkit
> git add <files>
> git commit -m "helpful message"
> git push
----

Best practice is to always commit changes as you work, rather than waiting until 
the end to commit changes. You can always revert to an old version if you need to!

Your code should download and compile without modifications. Test your assignment on a lab machine (Park 230) to ensure that it works. 

== Generating images, movies and gifs

*Screenshots*

On Ubuntu, you can take a screenshot by

* Prt Scrn to take a screenshot of the desktop.
* Alt + Prt Scrn to take a screenshot of a window.

*Gifs*

On Ubuntu, you can use Peek to create gifs.

video::Labs/howtopeek.mp4[width=600]

*Movies*

On Ubuntu, you can use `recordmydesktop` to record movies in .ogv format.

By default, the whole desktop is recorded unless you give it a window id.
To get the window id, call `xwininfo` and click on the window. Then pass the 
id to `recordmydesktop`.

----
> recordmydesktop --windowid <WindowId> --no-sound  --v_quality 30 -o <name>.ogv

To check the video, open it in firefox.

> firefox <name>.ogv

WARNING: Files larger than 100 MB cannot be checked into git. In general, 
videos should be less than 5 MB.

== Update your Readme.md

Update `{Dir}/Readme.md` to document the features in your assignment. Your readme should contain your images, gifs, and movies.

On github, you can drag and drop movies into your readme files. Images and gifs can also be added that way, or by including text such as the following
