<h2>Assignment 4: You spin me round!</h2>
<h3>Due October 4</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this assignment, you will implement conversions between euler angles 
   and matrices. To help test your conversions, you have been given a grid of 
   spinning teapots as well as a console program for unit testing. 

<p>In the teapot viewer, you should see a grid of teapots. The UI on the top
left allows you to enter test values. Each teapot tests a conversion
function. This week, you will implement 6 of the teapots to match the top
right. Next week, you will implement the remaining two teapots.

<h2>To Get Started: Read the <a href="../EulerAngles.html">Euler angle conversion notes</a></h2>

<h3>Question 0 (20 points): Converting between ZYX euler angles and matrices</h3>
<hr>

<p>Your basecode this week includes a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter
notebook</a> which uses the SymPy python library to compute symbolic
expressions for all 6 euler angle matrices. In class, we talked about how to go
between ZYX euler angles and a matrix. Let's check our understanding of this
process here.  </p>


<p><b>Aside: Running the Jupyter Notebook</b> You do not need to run the 
Jupyter notebook for your assignment this week. Instead, use the compiled 
output <a href="../EulerAngles.html">here</a>. However, if you would like the run it, you can download it from <a href="EulerAngles.ipynb">here</a>. To run, 
execute the following from the command line.
This will open a page in your browser that will allow you to 
edit the notebook.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">

</pre>

<p>Euler angles describe rotations as a sequence of rotations around each
axis. Any sequence is valid: we can rotate first around X, then Y, then Z; or
we can rotate first around Y, then X, and then Z.

<p>In our notebook, we define rotation matrices for each of these rotations 
   like so
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
# Define symbols
cx,sx = symbols('cx sx')
cy,sy = symbols('cy sy')
cz,sz = symbols('cz sz')

Rx = Matrix([ 
         [1, 0, 0], 
         [0, cx,-sx], 
         [0, sx, cx]])

Ry = Matrix([
         [ cy, 0, sy], 
         [ 0,  1, 0], 
         [-sy, 0, cy]])

Rz = Matrix([ 
         [cz, -sz, 0], 
         [sz,  cz, 0], 
         [0,    0, 1]]) 

</pre>

<p>Once we have each rotation matrix, we can compute the matrix corresponding
to XYZ euler angles like so. 

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
print("Rxyz")
pprint(Rx * Ry * Rz)

Rxyz
|      cy⋅cz             -cy⋅sz         sy  |
|                                           |
|cx⋅sz + cz⋅sx⋅sy   cx⋅cz - sx⋅sy⋅sz  -cy⋅sx|
|                                           |
|-cx⋅cz⋅sy + sx⋅sz  cx⋅sy⋅sz + cz⋅sx  cx⋅cy |

</pre>

<p>Let's take a look at this matrix and answers several questions about it.
Please put the answers to the following questions in your readme for this
week.

<p><b>Q1</b>: What is an orthogonal matrix? Show that 
<ul>
<li> one column has length 1, and that
<li> the same column is perpendicular to the other two
</ul>

<p>If you have shown that more columns have unit length or are perpendicular to
the other two, you will receive extra credit.

<p><b>Q2</b>: What matrix element would be the easiest to get an angle back?

<p><b>Q3</b>: Recall that tan = sin/cos. How could we use this to get the other angles back?

<p><b>Q4</b>: What happens when the rotation around the Y axis is 90 degrees? 

<p><b>Q5</b>: If the Y rotation is 90 degrees, how can we get the X and Z values back?

<p><b>Q6</b>: Show that when the rotation around Y is 90 degrees, the values for X and Z are not unique. 

<p><b>Q7</b>: Consider the following matrix. What does each column represent? 

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
|0   -cx⋅sz + cz⋅sx  cx⋅cz + sx⋅sz|
|0   cx⋅cz + sx⋅sz   cx⋅sz - cz⋅sx|
|-1        0               0      |
</pre>

<p><b>Q8</b>: Consider the following matrix. Suppose we want to use this matrix to 
   convert a character's local axes to world coordinates.  How do we do this?

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
|0   -cx⋅sz + cz⋅sx  cx⋅cz + sx⋅sz|
|0   cx⋅cz + sx⋅sz   cx⋅sz - cz⋅sx|
|-1        0               0      |
</pre>

<p><b>Q9</b>: Suppose we tried to extract euler angles from a matrix that was not orthogonal. 
What are some problems we would encounter?

<p><b>Q10</b>: What is the inverse of the rotation matrix corresponding to XYZ euler angles, in 
terms of Rx, Ry, and Rz matrices?

<h3>(12 points) Implement the conversions from euler angles to a matrix</h3>
<hr>

<p>To start, implement the function <b>AMatrix3::fromEulerAnglesZYX()</b>. You can
find this function in <b>libsrc/animation/AMatrix3-basecode.cpp</b>. This function
takes a parameter called angleRad which stores euler angles as a 3-tuple
<ul>
<li>angleRad[0] contains the rotation around the X axis (in radians)
<li>angleRad[1] contains the rotation around the Y axis (in radians)
<li>angleRad[2] contains the rotation around the Z axis (in radians)
</ul> 

<p>To implement this function, you can take two approaches
  <ul>
     <li>Set the contents of the matrix to correspond to the matrix we computed in the previous section 
     <li><b>Recommended: </b>Implement functions to create Rx,Ry,Rz matrices and then multiply them together
  </ul>

<p>AMatrix3 supports two types of syntax for accessing elements: indexing or by 
element name. For example, 

<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
std::cout << mM[0][0] << std::endl; // indexing notation
std::cout << m11 << std::endl; // lecture matrix notation
mM[row][col] = 0.4;
m11 = 3;
</pre>

<ol>
<li>(2 points) Implement AMatrix3::fromEulerAnglesZYX()
<li>(2 points) Implement AMatrix3::fromEulerAnglesXYZ()
<li>(2 points) Implement AMatrix3::fromEulerAnglesXZY()
<li>(2 points) Implement AMatrix3::fromEulerAnglesYZX()
<li>(2 points) Implement AMatrix3::fromEulerAnglesYXZ()
<li>(2 points) Implement AMatrix3::fromEulerAnglesZXY()
</ol>

<p>To run the unit tests from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a4-testEuler 
</pre>
</p>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>(60 points) Implement the conversion from a matrix to euler angles </h3>
<hr>

<p>Using the formulations from notebook, extract the X, Y, and Z angles from
the matrix. In your implementation, be carefull of edge cases around 90
degrees! 

<ol>
<li>(10 points) Implement AMatrix3::toEulerAnglesZYX()
<li>(10 points) Implement AMatrix3::toEulerAnglesXYZ()
<li>(10 points) Implement AMatrix3::toEulerAnglesXZY()
<li>(10 points) Implement AMatrix3::toEulerAnglesYZX()
<li>(10 points) Implement AMatrix3::toEulerAnglesYXZ()
<li>(10 points) Implement AMatrix3::toEulerAnglesZXY()
</ol>

<p>To run the teapots from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a4-teapots 
</pre>
</p>

<p>To run the unit tests from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a4-testEuler 
</pre>
</p>


<hr>
<h2>Extra Credit (Up to 4 points)</h2>
<hr>

<p><b>Option 1</b> Write unit tests to check your conversions 
(0.1 per unique test. A unique test should execute a different control path in each function). 
A simple test application could look like the following. Try to test 
edge cases too! Extend your CMakeLists.txt file to create a new 
test application. All you test code should be stored in assignments/a1-a2-rotations

<pre>
void RunTest()
{
   // create a matrix from euler angles
   AMatrix3 m, m1;
   m.fromEulerAngles(angles); // note: you will need to set angles

   // convert from the matrix back to euler angles
   AVector3 test = m.toEulerAngles();

   // convert back to matrix again
   m1.fromEulerAngles(test);

   // Check whether m == m1 and print the result
}

void main(int argc, char** argv)
{
   RunTest();
}
</pre>

<p><b>Option 2</b> Now that your framework supports euler rotations, you can make new types of interesting demos! As in the last assignment, create an interesting 2D demo that rotates objects. 

<p><b>Option 3</b> Show that all the columns in Q1 have unit length and are orthogonal (1/3 each)
