<h2>Assignment 5: Quazy quaternions</h2>
<h3>Due October 11</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this assignment, you will implement conversions between quaternions,
matrices, and angle/axis representations for rotation.  To help test your
conversions, re-use the teapot demo from <a href="lab4-euler.html">assignment
4</a>. 

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 1: Ripples (15 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this question, we will use rotations around the Z axis to create a ripple 
effect. This question is split into steps 

<b>Part 1: Draw a NxN grid of cuboids (2 points)</b>

<p>Re-purpose your code from assignment 2 to draw a grid of cuboids. Unlike in 
assignment 2 (gradient), these cuboids should be longer than they are wide to 
create stripes across the screen. (Hint: to change the width of the cuboid, 
use the last parameter to ADrawCube to adjust the dimensions)

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<b>Part 2: Use atan2 to rotate cuboids towards the target (3 points)</b>

<p>Re-purpose your code from assignment 1 (look) to use atan2 to compute 
an angle that points from the cuboid's position to the target. The calculation 
will give you an angle which you can use to rotate the cuboid towards the 
target. (Hint: the axis of rotation is the Z axis. Use euler angles to create 
an AMatrix3 to pass to ADrawCube).

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<p>Next, modify your code so that only cuboids within 100 units of the target 
are pointed towards it.

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<b>Part 3: Interpolate cuboids smoothly back to their original orientations (10 points)</b>

<p>To accomplish this effect, you will need to store the Z angle for each cuboid. 
If the cuboid's position is further than 100 units away from the target, you should 
blend its current angle with zero. In our interpolations for assignment 2, we kept 
track of the start and end values so we could vary the quantity based on 

<pre>
angle = start * (1-t) + end * t
</pre>

<p>For this animation, we will perform an exponential blend back to zero. This is 
simpler to implement than a linear blend merely need decrease the currentAngle back 
to zero each frame, e.g.  

<pre>
angle = currentAngle * pow(rate, dt())
</pre>
 
<p>For example, if rate = 0.1, we will decrease currentAngle by pow(0.1, dt()) each frame. This will quickly reduce the angle towards zero. 

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<p>To finish up the animation, use the flag _buttonDown so that the cuboids do not 
point towards the target unless the user is pressing the left mouse button (e.g. 
when _buttonDown = true, the user is pressing the left mouse button).

<h3>Question 2: Converting between angle/axis and quaternions (10 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this question, you will implement conversions between quaternions and 
angle-axis representations for rotation.

<p>Recall that the relationship between quaternions and an angle/axis rotation is

\(
q = \left[\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \hat{u}, \cos(\frac{\theta}{2})\right]
\) 

<ol>
<li>(5 points) Implement <b>AQuaternion::fromAngleAxis</b> in <b>libsrc/animation/AQuaternion-basecode.cpp</b>
<li>(5 points) Implement <b>AQuaternion::toAngleAxis</b> in <b>libsrc/animation/AQuaternion-basecode.cpp</b>
</ol>

<p>To run the unit tests from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a5-testQuat 
</pre>
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
// accessing member variables in AQuaternion works similarly to AMatrix3
mX = 0.5;
mY = 0.0;
mZ = 3.0;
mW = -5.0;
normalize(); // make myself a unit quaternion

AQuaternion q; // create an identity quat
q[0] = 0.1; // x value
q[1] = 0.1; // y value
q[2] = 0.1; // z value
q[3] = 0.1; // w value
q.normalize(); // make q a unit quaternion
</pre>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 3: Converting from a quaternion to a matrix (15 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In class, we derived the rotation matrix corresponding to a quaternion 
\( q = (x, y, z, w) = (\bar{v}), w \).

\[
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1-2(y^2+z^2) & 2(x y - w z) & 2(x z + w y) \\
2(x y + w z) & 1-2(x^2+z^2) & 2(y z - w x) \\
2(x z - w y) & 2(y z + w x) & 1-2(y^2+x^2) \\
\end{array} \right)
\]

<ol>
<li>(5 points) 
Suppose we have a quaternion corresponding to a 45 degree rotation around the Z 
axis. Verify that the matrix above reduces to a Z rotation matrix \( R_Z(45) \).
Write your answer in your readme for this week.
<li>(10 points) Implement the above matrix to convert from a AQuaternion to an AMatrix3 in <b>AQuaternion::toMatrix()</b> located in <b>libsrc/animation/AQuaternion-basecode.cpp</b>

<h3>Question 4: Converting from a matrix to a quaternion (22 points)</h3>
<hr>

<ol>
<li>(6 points) Consider the matrix above. In class, we showed that 
\( w^2 = \frac{1}{4}(m_{11} + m_{22} + m_{33} + 1) \). Using the diagonal terms, 
derive expressions for 
<ul>
		<li>\( x^2\)
		<li>\( y^2\)
		<li>\( z^2\)
</ul>
<li>(6 points) Consider the matrix above. Using the off-diagonal terms, derive expressions for 
<ul>
		<li>\( w x\)
		<li>\( w y\)
		<li>\( w z\)
		<li>\( x y\)
		<li>\( x z\)
		<li>\( y z\)
</ul>
<li>(10 points) Implement the algorithm for converting from AMatrix3 to AQuaternion. Your implementation should go in <b>AQuaternion::fromMatrix()</b> in <b>libsrc/animation/AQuaternion-basecode.cpp</b>.
<p>Using the expressions above, we can extract a quaternion from a rotation matrix, 
similarly to how we extract euler angles from a matrix. 
A numerically stable approach is to 

<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
//solve for w^2, x^2, y^2, and z^2
//Find the term with the largest value
//Based on the largest component, compute the remaining terms using the off-diagonal matrix elements.
</pre>

<p>For example, if \( w^2 \) is the largest, we would then solve for x, y, and z using 
the expressions for \( w x \), \( w y \), and \( w z \).

<li>(5 points) Consider the matrix \( R_Z(45) \) from the previous question. 
Apply this algorithm to obtain the original quaternion back.
</ol>

<p>To run the unit tests from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a5-testQuatMat 
</pre>
</p>

</pre>
</p>

<!--
<br>
<br>
<b>Numerical stability</b>
<br>

<p>You may be asking yourself why we can't just use the diagonal terms to extract 
our quaternion. Or why we can simply always solve for the same component 
and use the same off-diagonal terms. 

<p>When performing computations we have to be careful to avoid

<ul>
		<li>taking sqrts of negative numbers
		<li>dividing by zero
		<li>dividing by very small numbers (in general)
</ul>

<p><b>Question 6 (5 points) </b>
For example, compute the matrix that corresponds to a 180 degree rotation around Y. 
What would the values for \( w^2 \), \( x^2 \), \( y^2 \), and \( z^2 \) be?  What 
happens if you compute w and then try to use the off-diagonal terms to compute x, y, 
and z?

<p>In practice, your matrices will not have values that are exactly 0, -1 or exactly 1. 
The will be slightly less or greater than these values. In the case above, it's 
possible that computing w results on a NaN (Not a Number) if the parameter of the 
sqrt is slightly negative. Rather than add checks in our code, using the above 
proposed method avoids these pitfalls altogether.

<p>Include your answers in your readme for this week.
