<h1>CS56 Computer Animation: Lab 10</h1>
<div id="TagLine">
   In which, we play with physics and possibly choose our own adventure....
</div>
<hr>
     
<p>The goal of this lab is to 
<ul>
<li> gain hands-on experience using a physics engine
<li> explore additional topics of your choosing for extra credit!
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Get the source</h2>
<hr>

<p>This assignment has been added to your AnimationFramework repository.  To get the source, run

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
> cd cs56/AnimationToolkit 
> git pull
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make
</pre>

<p>You should now have a new directory under assignments called
<b>a10-physics</b>.

<h2>Assignment 10: Use the force</h2>
<h3>Due December 12</h3>
<hr>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 1: Computing forces and torques (5 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this question, use Newton's equations of motion to compute the net force 
and net torque for the following box. Show your calculations in your readme 
for this week.

<ul>
<li>The box has mass 10.0 and dimensions (100, 200, 100)
<li>The box starts at position (0,0,0)
<li>Each frame, we apply two forces. The forces and positions are given in the 
box's local coordinate frame. 
<ul>
<li>a linear force of (0, 0, 10) applied at position (-50,0,-50) 
<li>a linear force of (0, 0, 5) applied at position (50,0,-50) 
</ul>
</ul>

<p>To check your work, use <a
href="http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual">ODE</a> to simulate the box
and print out the forces and torques each frame. Verify that you get the same
result that you calculated in your readme. Use <b>ABoxSim1</b> as a guide.
CAREFUL: don't forget to compare your answers against the simulated forces in 
local coordinates!

<p>To run the demo from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a10-forces 
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Question 2: Unstoppable!! (10 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this question, you will implement a character that can interact with a 
physically-simulated wall. This demo will require defining both kinematic and 
dynamic objects in the ODE physics engine. The character will consist of 
kinematic objects and the wall will consist of dynamic objects.  
Use the code in <b>ABoxSim3</b> as an example.

<p>Helpful Reference: <a href="https://www.ode-wiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual:_All">Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) Reference Manual</a>

<br>

<p>To run the demo from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a10-unstoppable 
</pre>
</p>
<br>

<p>Controls
<ul>
<li>Press spacebar to reset the simulation
<li>Press 'd' to toggle the display to show either the character or physics objects
<li>
</ul>

<p>Features
<ul>
<li>Create a wall of bricks. The wall width should be at least 200 and height should be 200. Place the wall so it is perpendicular to the +Z axis, with its base centered at position (0,0,100). Each brick should be dynamically simulated
<ul>
<li>Each brick should have dimensions (50, 50, 50) and mass 50.
<li>Create a rigid body for each brick using dBodyCreate()
<li>Create a collision object for each brick using dCreateBox()
</ul>
<li>For each joint of the skeleton, create a kinematically simulated sphere. Each 
sphere should have radius 2 and total mass equal to 5.
<ul>
<li>Create a rigid body for the sphere using dBodyCreate
<li>Set the rigid body to be kinematic using dBodySetKinematic
<li>Create a collision object for the sphere using dCreateSphere
<li>Each frame, update the position of the spheres based on the global positions of each joint
</ul>
<li>Draw the boxes and spheres simulated by your program
</ul>

<h3>BONUS: Fireworks (5 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this question, you will implement fireworks using particle systems.
Implement your solution in <b>assignments/a10-physics/fireworks.cpp</b>

<br>
<br>
<img src="fireworks.gif">
<br>
<br>

<p>To run the demo from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a10-fireworks 
</pre>
</p>
<br>

<p>For this demo, implement a rocket that explodes into 
fireworks when the user presses the space bar.  

<p>Each firework should contain two particle systems: one which 
represents the rocket and one which represents the the exploded firework.
Fireworks go through three stages: ROCKET, EXPLODE, DONE.  

<ul>
<li>ROCKET: a rocket particle should be initialized with a randomized start 
velocity and "time to live". When the rocket's time to live expires, the firework 
switches to mode EXPLODE. 
<li>EXPLODE: N sparks are initialized at the current location of the rocket 
with randomized velocities extending in a circle arond the start position. 
Each particle should get a "time to live". When all firework particles have 
exceeded their time to live, the firework switches to mode DONE
<li>DONE: The firework is no longer updated or drawn and is available for re-launch
by the user.
</ul>

<p>Features
<ol>
<li>Particles should contain 
<ul>
<li>mass, velocity, position, color, time to live, transparency, and size
<li>derivatives for position and velocity
<li>accumilated forces
</ul>
<li>In update, compute the derivative and update each particle's state. Additionally, decrement ttl by the delta time.
<li>Create a new rocket when the user presses spacebar
<li>When a particle expires, it should either be deleted or recycled as part of an object pool. 
<li>Randomize the properties of the particles. 
<li>Define at least one external force to act on the particles (e.g. gravity)
<li>Visualize the rocket with a cone. The cone should face the direction that the 
particle is moving.
</ol>

<h3>BONUS: Behave! (10 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this question, you will animate a simple crowd using boid behaviors. 
Implement your behaviors in <b>assignments/a10-physics/ABehaviors.cpp</b>

<b>assignments/a10-physics/ASteerable.cpp</b>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a10-behaviors 
</pre>

<p>This demo requires you to have a placeholder character 
drawn as a sphere. 

<p>Implement the steering behaviors in ABehaviors.cpp. The basecode 
provides a UI for tweaking parameters and for environment

<p>Features
<ul>
<li>Implement AFlee:calculateDesiredVelocity
