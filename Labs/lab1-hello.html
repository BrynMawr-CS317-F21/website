<h2>Assignment: Hello Animation! Nice to meet you!</h2>
<h3>Due September 13</h3>
<hr>

<h3>Question 1: Eyes! (5 points)</h3>

<p></p>An easy way to create smooth motion is to use sine() or cosine() to
change an object's properties. For this question, modify the code in
<b>assignments/a1-hello/eyes.cpp</b> to draw a pair of eyes. Then use sine()
to animate two eyes like so.</p>

<p>To run your program from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a1-eyes 
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Tip: </b> sin() will smoothly vary between 1 and -1 given smoothly
increasing values. Use elapsedTime() (defined in "AFramework.h") as the input
to sin().</p>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Question 2: Look! (5 points)</h3>

<p>In class, we talked about how atan2 (tangent) can be used to compute an angle 
given a point. For this question, you will animate the eyes from Question 1 to 
follow a target. Your solution should use tangent to compute the position of 
the pupils.</p>

<p>The target is indicated with a red dot. To move it, click and hold down
the left mouse button to drag it to a new location. </p>

<p>Implement your solution in <b>assignments/a1-hello/look.cpp</b>.
To run your program from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a1-look 
</pre>
</p>

<img src="look.gif"/>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Question 3: Particles on the move (10 points)</h3>

<p>In class, we talked about how to animate a particle to move in a <a
href="particle.cpp.txt"></a>straight line</a>. In this assignment, we will
extend this program to animate *lots* of particles moving in a straight
line.</p>

<p>Implement your program in <b>assignments/a1-hello/velocity.cpp</b> 
   To run your program from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a1-velocity 
</pre>
</p>

<img src="velocity.gif"/>
<br>

<p>This program should support the following features
<ul>
   <li>Create 100+ particles, randomly distributed across the screen</li>
   <li>Particles should all move in the same direction, but at different speeds</li>
   <li>Particles should wrap when they move off the screen. For example, if a
   particle's X position is greater than the window width, it should be reset
   to 0.</li>
   <li>Particle colors should also be randomized</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>It is up to you how to implement your program. However, some recommendations
<ul>
   <li>Use <b>particle.cpp</b> as a reference</li>
   <li>Implement moving particles first</li>
   <li>Implement random colors afterwards</li>
   <li>Define a struct or class to hold the state for
   each particle. The state would include the particle's position, color, and
   velocity.</li>
   <li>Store your particles in a vector or array. Initialize them in setup().
   Update them in update(). Draw them in draw().</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Tip: Color Jitter</b> The easiest way to generate a random color is to
sample a random value for each red, green, and blue component. However, in
the example above, we used a different approach called <i>color
jittering</i>. To jitter color, we start with a base color and then add
random deviations from it. For example, if our base color were blue, (0.2,0.8,0.2),
we can jitter its components by adding random values in the range [-0.2,
0.2]. This gives us colors that are close to the original but still has 
variety.

<br>
<br>
<h3>Question 4: Hypnotic circles (10 points)</h3>

<p>In class, we talked about how to animate a particle to move in a <a
href="circle.cpp.txt"></a>circle</a>. In this assignment, we will
extend this program to animate particles moving in concentric circles.</p>

<p>Implement your solution in <b>assignments/a1-hello/circles.cpp</b>
   To run your program from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a1-circles 
</pre>
</p>
</p>

<img src="circles.gif"/>
<br>

<p>This program should support the following
<ul>
   <li>Create 36*N particles, where N is the number of concentric circles. Each circle should have 36 particles, spaced 10 degrees apart.</li>  
   <li>Alternating circles should rotate in opposite directions.</li>
   <li>Particles in the same circle should share the same color.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Tip: Color Palettes</b> A color palette is a simple method for generating
harmonious colors. In this approach, we define a list of colors to use in our 
application. When we need a color, we choose it from this list. 
Above, we used the following palette.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
   //https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/82379
   std::vector<AVector3> pallet = 
   {
      AVector3(0,165,227)/255.,
      AVector3(141,215,191)/255.,
      AVector3(255,150,197)/255.,
      AVector3(255,87,104)/255.,
      AVector3(255,162,58)/255.
   };
</pre>
</p>

<h3>BONUS: Do something cool or quirky (up to 2 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>Even with just spheres, it's possible to make an interesting demo!
<br> 
<br> 

<img src="spiral.gif" height="100px">
<img src="peek.gif" height="100px">
<a href="http://thebookofshaders.com/edit.php#09/marching_dots.frag"><img src="transformEx-bookofshaders.gif" height="100px"></a>

<p>Create a unique animation effect. For credit, you must submit your code
and a video or gif. You can capture a video using <b>recordmydesktop</b>
(instructions below) or with <b>Peek</b>.

<p>You can easily create your own programs by copying an existing demo and then editing 
   <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> to build it. See one of the same programs for an example!
</p>

<p>Some ideas

<ul>
<li> Animate color and size
<li> Change the color based on the current position
<li> Use different shapes
<li> Use more interesting velocities for the particles, for example
<ul>
  <li>Use sin/cos to create falling snow or rising bubbles
  <li>Create a spiral animation (see above)
</ul>
<li>Create an animated scene (like the above face)
</ul>
