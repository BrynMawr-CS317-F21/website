<h1>CS56 Computer Animation: Lab 7</h1>
<div id="TagLine">
   In which, we take our first steps making our characters step
</div>
<hr>
     
<p>The goals of this lab are to 
<ul>
<li> Use transforms to draw geometry relative to joints
<li> Begin working with motion capture data
<li> Animate more complex characters
</ul>

<h2>Get the source</h2>
<hr>

<p>This assignment has been added to your AnimationToolkit repository.  To get the source, run

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
> cd cs56/AnimationToolkit 
> git pull
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make
</pre>

<p>You should now have a new directory under assignments called <b>a7-motion</b>. 

<br>

<h2>Assignment 7: Commotion of motion</h2>
<h3>Due November 8</h3>
<hr>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Getting started: Run the motion viewer</h3>
<hr>

<p>Check that your basecode has core functionality running properly by 
running the motion viewer.

<p>To run the demo from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a7-motionviewer 
</pre>
</p>

<br>
<center>
<video controls>
		<source src="walk.ogv">
</video>
</center>

<br>
<b>User interface overview</b>
<br>

<p>When you open the viewer, it opens a character along with several example motions.

<p>The camera can be controled with the mouse:

<ul>
    <li>Left-button drag with the mouse to rotate
    <li>Right-button drag with the mouse to pan
    <li>Middle-button drag with the mouse to zoom
    <li>'f' button will focus the view on the character
</ul>

<p>The player control panel on the top left can be used to load and play files.
The panel at the bottom left can be used to load different BVH files.

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 1: Motion practice (5 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>For this question, use the APIs in <b>AMotion</b>, <b>APose</b> and <b>ASkeleton</b> 
to finish the implementation in <b>assignments/a7-motion/APracticeMotion.cpp</b>.

<p><b>AMotion</b> is defined in <b>libsrc/animation/AMotion.h</b>
<p><b>ASkeleton</b> is defined in <b>libsrc/animation/ASkeleton.h</b>
<p><b>APose</b> is defined in <b>libsrc/animation/APose.h</b>

<p>To run the demo from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a7-practice 
</pre>
</p>
<br>

<p><b>AMotion</b> implements a fixed-framerate motion loaded from a <a
href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/cs-838-1999/Jeff/BVH.html">BVH
file</a>.  A motion stores a sequence of a <b>APose</b>. Each APose stores the
state of the skeleton on that frame .  Because AMotion represents motions with
a fixed framerate, the time between each key is 1/fps. Fps stands for frames
per second. For the characters in this class, poses contain the root position
and the rotations for each joint. All pose data is always in local coordinates.
The order of the joint rotations in <b>APose</b> matches the IDs in
<b>ASkeleton</b>.  For example, the joint with ID = 5 has its local rotation
stored in jointRots[5].

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 2: Thriller (5 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this question, you will implement dancers performing the 80s classic: Thriller!
Implement your solution in <b>assignments/a7-motion/AThriller.cpp</b>.
You will use the methods in <b>ASkeletonDrawer</b> defined in <b>libsrc/ui/ASkeletonDrawer.h</b> 
for this question. Note that to draw multiple characters with the same synchronized animations,
we only need one skeleton and multiple drawers!

<p>To run the demo from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a7-thriller 
</pre>
</p>

<br>
<center>
<video controls>
<source src="thriller.ogv">
</video>
</center>

<br>
<p>Your solution should have the following features:
<ul>
<li>Use a vector or array to store drawers for every character in the crowd
<li>Arrange 12 characters in a 4x3 grid across the floor. Use ASkeletonDrawer::setOffsetPosition.
<li>Jitter the positions of the characters so that the alignment is not exact.
<li>Randomize the colors of the characters. Use ASkeletonDrawer::setColor
<li>Randomize the sizes of the characters. Use ASkeleton::setScale
</ul>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 3: Simple controller (10 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>For this question you will implement a simple character controlled with the keyboard.
We will use the motion from <b>motions/Beta/walking.bvh</b> to animate the body but 
the root will be animated based on keyboard input.

<p>To run the demo from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a7-controller 
</pre>
</p>

<br>
<b>Step 1: Pin the root</b>
<br>

<p>Modify the pose of the skeleton so that the character's body animates but does not move.

<br>
<br>
<img src="wasd1.gif">
<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Step 2: Visualize the heading</b>
<br>

<p>The user can change the heading of the character by pressing 'a' and 'd' or the left and right arrow buttons. 
When the user pressing 'a' or left, the heading turns left. To start, draw the heading on the floor at the 
location of the character. Hint: use the global position of the character to compute endpoints for a line. 
Use <b>ADrawLine</b> to draw the direction of the heading.

<br>
<br>
<img src="wasd2.gif">
<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Step 3: Turn the body to match the heading</b>
<br>

<p>Modify the pose of the skeleton so that the character rotates with the heading


<br>
<br>
<img src="wasd3.gif">
<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Step 4: Set the camera to follow the character</b>
<br>

<p>When we update the character, modify the camera position and look target so that it's behind the 
character's head. Use the global position of the character's head to compute positions  
for the camera. You will need global positions for the camera's position and for the target 
where the camera is looking. 

<pre>
AVector3 globalPos;
AVector3 globalLookPos;
...
ACamera* camera = getCamera();
camera->set(globalPos, globalLookPos, AVector3(0,1,0) /*up*/);
</pre>

<br>
<br>
<img src="wasd4.gif">
<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Step 5: Update the character position</b>
<br>

<p>Modify the pose of the skeleton so that the character both rotates and moves with the heading. 
Update the position of the skeleton's root similarly to how you animated 
a particle to move in a straight line. In this case, velocity is based on the heading and the 
desired speed.

<h3>Question 4: Butterfly (10 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this questio, you will complete the butterfly demo. Put your solution in 
<b>assignments/a7-motion/AButterfly.cpp</b>

<p>To run the demo from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a7-butterfly 
</pre>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<img src="butterfly.gif" height="200">
<br>
<br>

Your solution should have the following features
<ul>
<li>Two+ primitives for each wing
<li>Animated wings
<li>Animated body
</ul>
