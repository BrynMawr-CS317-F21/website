</pre>

<p>You should now have a new directory under assignments called a3-splines.

<h2>Assignment 3: The Catmull-Rom Com</h2>
<h3>Due September 27</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this assignment you will implement classes in the animation library.
This code is in <b>libsrc/animation</b>. To start, look at <b>ASpline.h</b> and
<b>AInterpolator.h</b>. These classes define the APIs (Application Programming
Interfaces) you will work with this week.  The ASpline class manages a list of
keys (e.g.  times and values) and can interpolate between them using an
AInterpolator. How the spline interpolates between these keys will depend on
what type of AInterpolator the ASpline uses. 

<p>Your base code includes three types of AInterpolator. 
<ul>
<li>AInterpolatorLinear 
<li>AInterpolatorCatmullRom 
<li>AInterpolatorHermite 
</ul>

AInterpolator manages the list of control points for the spline. Subclasses of
AInterpolator compute control points in
<b>AInterpolator::computeControlPoints</b> and compute interpolated values in
<b>AInterpolator::interpolate</b>.

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>User interface overview</h3>
<hr>

<p>The basecode includes a simple UI to help you test your splines. 
<ul>
  <li>Blue points represent the input data (aka keys) which are interpolated between. 
  <li>Yellow points represent additional control points 
</ul>

<br>
<center>
<video controls>
		<source src="spline.ogv">
</video>
</center>
<br>

<p>The UI panel contains widgets for

<ul>
  <li><b>Type</b>: interpolation type (You will implement
Linear, Catmull-Rom, and Hermite interpolators for the spline.) <br>
    </li>
  <li><b>Mode</b>: 
how left mouse clicks are interpreted: <br>
    </li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Add</b>: append points to the curve
      </li>
    <li><b>Edit</b>: drag curve points (blue) and control points (yellow) using the
      </li>
    <li><b>Delete</b>: remove curve points (blue) <br>
      </li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Ctrl pts</b>: toggle the display of control points (yellow) <br>
    </li>
  <li><b>Clear</b>: remove the entire curve.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 0: Code questions (5 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>Please put the answers to the following questions in your readme for this week.

<ul>
<li>The spline passes a normalized time u in the range [0,1] to the interpolator. What formula is used to convert the general time (for example, the application time since startup) to a normalized time?
<li>Suppose a spline holds 3 keys. One at time 0, one at time 3, and one at time 5. If we call getValue(7, true), what segment will be used to interpolate? What formula is used to compute the normalized time u. What will the normalized time be?
<li>Suppose a spline holds 3 keys. One at time 0, one at time 3, and one at time 5. If we call getValue(7, false), what segment will be used to interpolate? What formula is used to compute the normalized time u? What will the normalized time be?
<li>Suppose a spline holds 3 keys. One at time 0, one at time 3, and one at time 5. If we call getValue(-2, false), what segment will be used to interpolate? What formula is used to compute the normalized time u? What will the normalized time be?
<li>Suppose a spline holds 3 keys. One at time 0, one at time 3, and one at time 5. What formula is used to compute the normalized duration? If we call getNormalizedDuration(7) what value is returned?
</ul>

<h3>Question 1: Linear interpolator (5 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>This question has two parts.

<p><b>Part 1</b>. For this question, modify the code in <b>AInterpolator-basecode.cpp (libsrc/animation)</b> to 
implement <b>AInterpolatorLinear::computeControlPoints</b> and <b>AInterpolatorLinear::interpolate</b>.
The method, computeControlPoints, should set two control points for each segment. The order of the 
control points matter and show match the order of the user's keys. 

<p>To test your implementation, use the viewer. From the <b>build</b> directory, type 

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a3-curveEditor 
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Part 2</b>. To start, the viewer should draw your keys but not the curve between them. To see your curve, 
implement the method <b>ACurveeditor::drawCurve</b> in <b>ACurveEditor.cpp</b>. Draw the spline similarly to how your drew 
your curves from the last assignment. 

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 2: Catmull-Rom interpolator (20 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>This question has multiple parts.

<p><b>Part 1 (10 points)</b> For this part, modify the code in
<b>AInterpolator-basecode.cpp (libsrc/animation)</b> to implement
<b>AInterpolatorCatmullRom::computeControlPoints</b>. For each segment, you 
should set b0, b1, b2, and b3 (in this order). Check the output of
<b>testCatmullRom.cpp</b> to check whether your implementation gives the same
results as our example from class. 

<p>To run your program from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a3-testCatmullRom 
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Part 2 (10 points)</b>. For this part, modify the code in
<b>AInterpolator-basecode.cpp (libsrc/animation)</b> to implement
<b>AInterpolatorCatmullRom::interpolate</b>. You can use any method (Bernstein
functions or de Casteljau's algorithm) to interpolate the segment.  Check the
output using the viewer. 

<p>To run from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a3-curveEditor 
</pre>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 3: Hermite interpolator (20 points)</h3>
<hr>
<p>This question has multiple parts.

<p><b>Part 1 (10 points)</b>. Modify the code in
<b>AInterpolator-basecode.cpp (libsrc/animation)</b> to implement
<b>AInterpolatorHermite::computeControlPoints</b>. For each input key p<sub>i</sub>, 
you should set p<sub>i</sub> and p'<sub>i</sub> as control points (in that order). Check the output of
<b>testHermite.cpp</b> to check whether your implementation gives the same
results as our example from class. 

<p>To run your program from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a3-testHermite 
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Part 2 (10 points)</b> Modify the code in <b>AInterpolator-basecode.cpp
(libsrc/animation)</b> to implement <b>AInterpolatorHermite::interpolate</b>.
You should use the Hermite form of the cubic bezier curve to interpolate.
Check the output using the viewer.  

<p>To run from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a3-curveEditor 
</pre>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 4: Animate the dot (5 points)</h3>
<hr>
<p>In <b>ACurveEditor::update()</b>, use your spline to animate a dot so it moves along the spline. The basecode in 
ACurveEditor has a member variable <b>mDot</b> with type AVector3. Update the value of mDot.

<br>
<br>

<hr>
<h2>Extra Credit (Up to 2 points)</h2>
<hr>

<p><b>Option 1</b>Improve ASpline::computeSegment. This method uses linear search to find the 
interval containing time. Replace the implementation to use binary search.

<p><b>Option 2</b> Now that your framework supports splines, 
try to make an interesting demo based on that. 
Some ideas 

<ul>
<li>Try animating the control points.</li>
<li>Try interpolating between curves.</li>
<li>Try animating an object's position/color/etc based on a spline.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<img src="balls.gif">
<br>

<p><b>Option 3</b> Implement your own interpolator type!
