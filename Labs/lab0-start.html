<h1>CS56 Computer Animation: Lab 0</h1>
<div id="TagLine">
   In which, we begin our work with git, cmake, and C++
</div>
<hr>

<p>There is no assignment associated with this lab. Today, we will set up our
development environment and review C++. We will use the same C++ code
framework throughout this course. For some assignments, you will implement
core features in the animation library. For other assignments, you will write
applications which use the animation library. The framework also includes a
simple graphics library for visualizing and controlling your animations.</p>

<p>Some of you may not feel comfortable programming in C++. This is ok! This
course is an opportunity to gain experience and this lab is intended to help
you gain your footing. Note that you can always look at the existing code in
the framework and then modify it to complete your assignments. You can also
post questions in Piazza. </p>
     
<p>The goals of this lab are
<ul>
   <li> Introduce the code framework for the assignments
   <li> Review C++ and setup our development environment
   <li> Introduce the coordinate systems we will use for 2D and 3D
   <li> Create static images with shapes and colors
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Get the source</h2>
<hr>

<p>The source is available from github.swarthmore.edu. We will use 
<b>git</b> to keep track of our source code throughout the semester.  

<p> You will need a Swarthmore git account for submitting assignments. 

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
> mkdir cs56
> cd cs56
> git clone git@github.swarthmore.edu:cs56-f19/AnimationToolkit-YOURUSERNAME.git AnimationToolkit
</pre>

<br>
<b>If you DO NOT have a Swarthmore github account yet</b>
<br>

<p>For those of you without an account yet, you can download the repository from 
<a href="AnimationToolkit-master.zip">here</a>. You can still use git locally 
to keep track of your changes. To submit, we will set the url to the remote 
repository manually (The professor will send you instructions once your 
account is setup).

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
> mkdir cs56
> cd cs56
> unzip AnimationToolkit-master.zip
> cd AnimationToolkit-master
> git init
> git add .
> git commit -m "assignment framework"
</pre>

<br>
<b>Ok, let's get started!</b>
<br>

<p>We will use the same framework for every assignment. Each week, you will
implement additional features inside this framework.

<p>Let's start by taking a look at the repository. It contains the following directories
<ul>
  <li>/libsrc - source files for animation and ui libraries. Most assignments will extend the animation library
  <li>/assignments - source files for demos and test applications
  <li>/motions - character and motion models 
  <li>/cmake-modules - helper build files for cmake 
  <li>CMakeLists.txt - top level build file for cmake
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Compile and run</h2>
<hr>

<p>We use <b>cmake</b> because it can support multiple platforms (such as
UNIX and Windows) with a single build configuration. For example, cmake
can generate Makefiles for UNIX and .vcproj files for Windows. 
Cmake stores its build settings in CMakeLists.txt files in
each directory.

<p>Because cmake generates a lot of temporary files, we use an 
<b>out of source build</b> to keep our repository clean. 

<p>In other words, we will create a separate directory named <b>/build</b> to
compile and link.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
> cd AnimationToolkit
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make 
</pre>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: We do not want to check in temporary files to git!!! We can 
tell git to ignore unwanted files by adding them to <b>.gitignore</b>. 
I've added build* to this file, so your temporary files are not checked 
into git. 

<p>After this step, you should have executables installed into a new
directory called <b>/bin</b>. To test, let's make sure the default viewers
work. These are implemented in <b>assignments/viewer2d</b> and
<b>assignments/viewer3d</b>. After building, you can run them from the
<b>/build</b> directory. Let's start with the default 3D scene:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
> ../bin/viewer3d
</pre>

<p>You should see a grid with a grey background. Dragging with the left mouse
will rotate (try it!) around the world origin. Middle mouse button will zoom.
Right mouse button will pan. Pressing 'Escape' or closing the window will
quit the application.<br> <img src="viewer3d.png" width=25% />

<p>Now try running viewer2d.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
> ../bin/viewer2d
</pre>

Oh no, just a blank screen!! Not to worry. The world is empty. We will add 
some objects to it soon.

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>Exercise: Drawing in 2D.</h2>
<hr>

<p>To start, let's look at the implementation of viewer2d in
<b>assignments/viewer2d/basicMain.cpp</b>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
#include "AFramework.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
   AFramework viewer(AFramework::Orthographic);
   viewer.init(argc, argv);
   viewer.run();
   return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>This code creates a window capable of receiving user input and
drawing graphics. The code for viewer3d is very similar. Each creates an
instance of <b>AFramework</b> and then calls init() and run(). The run()
function does not return until either 'Escape' is pressed or the window is
closed. AFramework::run() implements our <b>game loop</b>, which will invoke
callbacks for user events, update, and draw. 
         
<p>AFramework supports two types of scenes: 
   <ul>
      <li>orthographic (2D)</li>
      <li>perspective (3D)</li>
   </ul>

<p>In both, we use the term <b>camera</b> to refer to the location and
direction in the world that we can see objects. Moving the camera allows us
to see different parts of the world. The parameters of the camera control how
much of the world we can see (sometimes called a view volume). Only objects
in front of the camera can be seen.

<p>By the default, the 2D scenes in this course do not allow you to move the camera.
   In other words, only objects that have (X,Y) coordinates between (0,0) and 
   (screen width, screen height) can be seen. 
</p> 

<p><b>Orthographic</b><br><br> 
<img src="orthographic.png"/><br><br>
   <ul>
      <li>Viewable world is a cuboid 
      <li>Defines a cuboid having dimensions screenWidth x screenHeight x 2000 units. 
      The origin of the world is located at the bottom left corner of the window. 
      <li>The view volume extents are X = [0, screenWidth], Y = [0, screenHeight], and Z = [-1000,1000]
      <li>No perspective depth. In other words, every object looks to be the same distance away from the camera and parallel lines always appear parallel.
      <li>Basic program: viewer2d
   </ul>
<br>

<h2>Drawing shapes in 2D</h2>
<hr>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Example: Green sphere</h2>
<p>Look at the code in <b>assignments/a0-start/2d/greenSphere2d.cpp</b></p>

<p>Let's extend the default 2D scene to draw a green sphere in the center of
our screen. Because the bottom corner is the origin (e.g. has coordinate
(0,0,0)), we will draw the sphere at coordinate (screenWidth/2,
screenHeight/2,0). Note that although we will draw a sphere, it will look like
a circle in our 2D view. Also note that although our world looks 2D, it is 
actually 3D. If we want to draw shapes in front of our sphere, we increase the 
Z value; to draw behind the sphere, we decrease the Z value.

<p>NOTE: You can set the window size by passing width and height to init()
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
   viewer.init(argc, argv, 600, 400);
</pre>

<p><b>Try this!</b> Draw a larger sphere directly behind the green sphere.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Example: Red cube</h2>
<p>Now look at the code in <b>assignments/a0-start/redCube2d.cpp</b></p>

<p>Now let's draw a cube using the function ADrawCube. This function 
   takes a position like before, but it also takes arguments for setting the
   orientation and size. Thus, this function can be used to draw rotated cuboids, 
   not just cubes.

<p><b>Try this!</b> Change the scale of the cube to draw a rectangle.</p>

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>Drawing shapes in 3D</h2>
<hr>

Let's repeat the exercises above in 3D. Before, we drew shapes in the center
of the screen. Now we will draw them at the center of the 3D world, which is
at coordinate (0,0,0). You will also need to set materials instead of colors
because the lighting for the 3D scene uses shading, whereas the 2D scene does
not.

In summary, to go from 2D to 3D, we need to do:
<ul>
   <li>Change the scene type to AFramework::Projection</li>
   <li>Change the positions of your shapes</li>
   <li>Use ASetMaterial instead of ASetColor</li>
</ul> 

In the 3D scene, the extents of the world are different and the 
camera can be rotated and paned in the scene. Same as before, 
only objects that are in the camera's view can be seen. 
By default, this is objects that are with 500 units in front 
of the camera. 

<p><b>Perspective</b><br><br>
<img src="perspective.png"/><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Viewable world is a truncated four-sided pyramid
<li>Defines the pyramid with near distance = 0.1 and far distance = 500 and field of view = 60 degrees
<li>Perspective depth. Objects closer to the viewer are larger than those far away. This is a traditional 3D view.
<li>Basic program: viewer3d
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Example: Green sphere.</h3>
<p>Look at and run the code in assignments/a0-start/3d/greenSphere3d.cpp.</p>

<b>Try this! </b>Draw a second sphere at (5,0,5). 

<br>
<br>
<h3>Example: Red cube</h3>
<p>Look at the code in <b>assignments/a0-start/3d/redCube3d.cpp</b></p>

<b>Try this!</b> Draw a yellow cone instead of a cube. Look up the 
color yellow using an online resource such as <a href="https://rgbcolorcode.com/">this one</a>.
Read the header file AGLObjects.h (in libsrc/ui) for a function for 
drawing a cone.

<h2>Color tips and tricks</h2>

One tip for generating pretty patterns is to use algorithms for  
manipulating colors.

<hr>
<h3>Exercise 1: Draw a grid of spheres.</h2>
