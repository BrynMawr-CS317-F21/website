<h1>C++ Coding style guidelines</h1>
<hr>

<br>

<p>The primary goal of a coding style is 
to make a codebase easier to read through consistent syntax. For example, the framework used in class 
tries to uphold consistent capitalization and spacing. A secondary goal might also be to prohibit 
potentially risky code practices.  For example, using macros to define simple functions can result in surprising  
behavior! (<a href="#note1">*</a>). But using templates for such functions makes such bugs impossible. 
Thus, a coding standard might specify that templates should be preferred to macros.

<p>Below are the code style guidelines for the framework used in the animation course. Many of these 
are identical to Professor Tia Newhall's guidelines 
<a href="https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/cppcodestyle.html">here</a>.
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Prefer streams and stream operators rather than C style I/O functions
  <li>All classes should define virtual destructor functions
  <li>Each class definition should be in its own file. Filenames containing classes should match the classname.
  <li>Classnames start with captital letters and use camel case. 
  For example, ABlueClass (good!) but not Ablueclass (no!) aBlueClass (no!) or ablueclass (no!)
  <li>Local variables and public class variables should start with a lowercase letter and use camelCase
  For example, radiusHalf, but not RadiusHalf (no!) or _radiusHalf (no!) or _radiushalf (no!)
  <li>Protected and private class member variables should start with either _ or m; _ is preferred. Variables should be camelCase.
  For example, mRadiusHalf (ok) or _radiusHalf (good!) but not _RadiusHalf (no!) or radiusHalf (no!)
  <li>Classes and global variables and global functions are prefixed with A (to avoid name conflicts)
  <li>Avoid global variables
  <li>Avoid macros. Prefer const global variables or template functions instead.
  <li>Avoid multiple inheritance
  <li>Prefer pass by reference to pass by pointer
  <li>Never return a reference to a temporary object
  <li>Group functions by public/protected/private followed by member variables (public/protected/private followed by static variables
  <li>Avoid public member variables in classes. Instead create protected or private variable and define accessor/setter methods
  <pre>
  class foo
  {
  public:
    int getFoo() const { return _value; } 
    void setFoo(int v) { _value = v; }
  private:
    int _value;  // good!
  }
  </pre>
  and not
  <pre>
  class foo
  {
  
  public:
    int value; // avoid this, blech
  }
  </pre>
  <li>Put curly brackets on their own line, e.g. 
  <pre>
  if (i == 2)
  { // good!
  }
  </pre>
  but not
  <pre>
  if (i == 2) { // "egyptian style" no!
  }
  </pre>
</ul>

<b>Notes:</b>
<br>
<p id="note1">(1) Here's a good example from Scott Meyer's book <i>Effective C++</i>

<pre>
#define max(a,b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

int foo()
{
  int a = 5, b = 0;
  max(++a, b);    // a is incremented twice
  max(++a, b+10); // a is incremented once
}
</pre>
