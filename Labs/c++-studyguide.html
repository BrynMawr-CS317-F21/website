<h1>CS56: C++ Study Guide</h1>
<hr>
<br>
Regarding C++, you should be familiar with the following: 
<ul>
   <li>built-in types: int, bool, float, double, char. (We will use double by default).</li>
   <li>string types: char*, const char*, std::string</li>
   <li>control: if/else, for, while</li>
   <li>relationship operators: &gt;, &lt;, \&gt;=, &lt;=, ==, !=</li>
   <li>arithmetic: +, -, ++, --, /, *, %, NaN, sin, cos, asin, acos, tan, atan2</li> 
   <li>input/output using iostreams (std::cout, std::cin)</li>
   <li>arrays and std::vector</li>
   <li>classes: methods and member variables, inheritance (public, private, protected keywords), virtual methods, destructors, constructors</li>
   <li>pointers: new/delete (pointers are not used much in this course. And we will not use malloc/free ever!)</li>
   <li>functions: return types and parameters. (99% of your code for this class should be uses classes!), all logic will be in classes)</li>
   <li>header and source files</li>
   <li>pass-by-reference vs pass-by-value</li>
   <li>const parameters, const return types and const methods</li>
   <li>random number generation</li>
</ul>


Below are sample questions for practice.

<h3>What is the value and type for each of the following expressions?
<ul>
<li>2 + 3
<li>2++
<li>2.0 + 3
<li>5.5/10
<li>5/10
<li>10/5
<li>asin(2)
<li>8 % 6
<li>5 - 2 * 3
<li>"123"
<li>2.0
<li>2+4*2+1
<li>"Swat" + "CS"
</ul>

<h3>Q1: What is the output of the following program. Write a program that inputs two integers a and b and outputs a/b.</h3>
<h3>Q2: What is the output of the following program. Write a program that inputs N integers and outputs their average.</h3>
<h3>Q3: What is the output of the following program. Write a program that inputs a float and outputs the arcsine of that value in degrees.</h3>
<h3>Q4: What is the output of this program? (reference vs value)</h3>
<h3>Q4: What is the output of this program? (Class example)</h3>

<h3>Exercise</h3>Assume we have a word-count list, such as this: 

wc = [['around', 99], ['beer', 300], ['bottle', 3], ['bottles', 297], ['buy', 1], ['down', 99]]

Write a function to take a word-count list and return the word that has the highest count. For example, if called on the list above, the function should return "beer".

<h3>Exercise 4: Examine the following two functions. One takes a const reference, whereas the other one doesn't. Draw the function diagram for each.</h3>
<h3>Consider the following code. Will the compiler allow it?  Why or why not? (const example)
<h3>The following code doesn't compile. The error is TODO. What does this error mean and how can we fix it?
<h3>The following code doesn't compile. The error is TODO. What does this error mean and how can we fix it?
<h3>Header files often has the following pre- and post- ambles around them. Why are these needed? 
<h3>The following program compiles but has the following error when we run. Why? (Test seg fault/ Test Nan)
