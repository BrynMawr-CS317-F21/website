<h2>Assignment 6: Characters, big and small</h2>
<h3>Due November 1</h3>
<hr>


<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 1: Implement AQuaternion::Slerp (5 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>For this question, implement <b>AQuaternion::Slerp()</b> in
<b>libsrc/animation/AQuaternion-basecode.cpp</b>

<p>To run the unit test from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a6-testSlerp 
</pre>
</p>

<p>To run the teapot demo from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a6-slerpTeapot 
</pre>
</p>

<br>
<img src="slerpTeapot.gif">
<br>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 2: Keyframe animation (10 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this question, you will implement a simple animation using splines for position and rotation. 
Implement you solution in the file <b>AKeyframeCone.cpp</b>

<br>
<img src="coneAnimate.gif">
<br>

<p>Your solution should have the following features:
<ul>
<li>The cone should travel between the four corners (100,0,100), (-100,0,100), (-100, 0, -100), (100,0,-100) 
<li>The cone should have size (10,10,20).
<li>The forward direction of the cone is +Z. You should define keys for the cone's rotation that face it in the direction in which it is traveling. This rotation will be around the +Y axis. 
<li>The cone should pause to turn.
<li>You should animate positions using ASpline and rotations using AQuatSpline 
</ul>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 2: Implement ATransform (4 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>The <b>ATransform</b> class represents 4x4 homogeneous transforms as 2x2 block matrices. 
The transform's rotation \(R_j^i\) and translation \(d_j^i\) are public variables. 
Because the bottom row of such matrices are always known, we do not 
store them. Instead, we store the top left block as a rotation (e.g. AQuaternion) and the 
top right column as a vector. 

<p> Complete the implementation of the ATransform class in <b>libsrc/animation/ATransform-basecode.cpp</b>. 

<ol>
		<li><b>(1 points)</b> Implement <b>ATransform::inverse()</b>
<p>Returns a transform representing the inverse of this object. 
<li><b>(1 points)</b> Implement <b>ATransform::transformPoint(p)</b>
<p>Input 3D position to be transformed by this transform
<p>Output Transformed position
<li><b>(1 points)</b> Implement <b>ATransform::transformVector(v)</b>
<p>Input 3D vector to be transformed by this transform
<p>Output Transformed vector
<li><b>(1 points)</b> Implement the multiplication operator, e.g. <b>operator* (t1, t2)</b>. 
This function computes t1 * t2 
and returns returns the result
<p>Input The first transform t1 in the operation
<p>Input The second transform t2
<p>Output The resulting transform t1 * t2
</ol>

<p>To run tests from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a6-testTransform 
</pre>
</p>

<br>
To help you test, I recommend modifying <b>assignments/a6-characters/testTransform.cpp</b>
<ul>
<li>Add a test which multiplies t2 * t2Inv and print the result. You should get the identity matrix
<li>Create a transform that translates but doesn't rotate. Compute and print the inverse of this matrix.
</ul>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 3: Stacking Boxes (10 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>For this question, you will use the transform implementation from the previous 
section to position several boxes. Look at the code in <b>assignments/a6-characters/boxes.cpp</b>. 
You will need to modify it.

<p>A room has three boxes in it. Each box has a local coordinate system
attached to it. The lengths of all three boxes in the x,y, and z directions of
their local coordinate frames are (3,2,1) respectively. The origin of each box
is in the lower left-hand corner.  The z-axis of each box is aligned with the
global Z axis.

<p>The position of B1 with respect to the world (e.g. coordinate system {X<sub>0</sub>,Y<sub>0</sub>,Z<sub>0</sub>}) is
<b>p<sub>1</sub></b> = [-2 0 1]<sup>T</sup>.

<p>The position of B2 with respect to the world is <b>p<sub>2</sub></b> = [4 0 2]<sup>T</sup>.

<p>The position of B3 with respect to the world is <b>p<sub>3</sub></b> = [5 4 2]<sup>T</sup>.

<p>Furthermore, with respect to the world coordinate system, B2 is rotated 45 degrees around Z<sub>0</sub> and
B3 is rotated 90 degrees around Z<sub>0</sub>.

<br>
<br>
<img src="boxes-2019.png" width=40%>
<br>
<br>

In your readme, writeup answers to the following questions in terms of algebraic expressions in terms 
of rotations and displacement vectors. Then, implement you answers in <b>boxes.cpp</b> to check your 
work.  

<ol>
   <li>List the frames of reference F<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>,
   F<sub>2</sub><sup>0</sup>, F<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> (in the form of homogeneous matrices) that describe the
   position and orientations of boxes B1, B2, and B3 with respect to the world.</li>
   <li>What is the position of B2 relative to the local coordinate system attached to box B1? Express your answer as a displacement vector.</li>
   <li>What is the position of B3 relative to the local coordinate system attached to box B2? Express your answer as a displacement vector.</li>
   <li>What is the homogeneous transformation matrix that stack B2 onto B1?</li>
</ol>

<p>To run the demo from the <b>build</b> directory, type
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a6-boxes 
</pre>

<h3>Question 4: Skeleton (10 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this question, you were learn about the <b>ASkeleton</b> and <b>AJoint</b> classes in your basecode.

<p>Read the header files for ASkeleton and AJoint in <b>libsrc/animation/ASkeleton.h</b> and 
<b>libsrc/animation/AJoint.h</b> and then complete the program in <b>assignments/a6-character/ASkeletonPractive.cpp</b>
This file loads a BVH file and prints information about the character in it. For more details, read below.

<p>To run the demo from the <b>build</b> directory, type
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a6-skeleton 
</pre>
</p>


<br>
<b>Summary of ASkeleton and AJoint</b>
<br>
<p>The term scene graph, or hierachy, is typically used to organize all the transforms in a scene. A skeleton is 
a sub-tree of the scene graph, which represents a single character. Your base code already includes a class 
for managing skeletons in <b>ASkeleton</b> in <b>libsrc/animation/ASkeleton.h</b>. In this question, you 
will read the ASkeleton class, answer questions, and write a small program to understand how it works.

<p>In your SceneGraph, you created nodes to hold each transform. In the
basecode, the nodes correspond to <b>AJoint</b> in
<b>libsrc/animation/AJoint.h</b> Each joint has a unique ID (unsigned integer),
name, pointer to its parent joint, and a list of children.  The root joint has
ID zero and a NULL parent. The skeleton contains a pointer to the root joint. 

<p>Joints are implemented in the <b>AJoint</b> class. AJoint stores a transformation from 
its own coordinate frame to its parent in its <b>local2parent</b> transform. This transform 
contains the offset from the parent in <b>LocalTranslation</b> and the relative rotation from 
the parent in <b>LocalRotation</b>. In this assignment, you will implement a recursive 
forward kinematics algorithm which will compute the joint's <b>local2global</b> transformations 

<p>You can create characters from scratch using the methods in ASkeleton and AJoint. However, we 
usually load characters (and motion) from a file. Your basecode supports a file format called 
<a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/cs-838-1999/Jeff/BVH.html">BVH</a>. The first part of the file contains the hierachy of joints and the second part 
contains root positions and joint orientations to use for animation. A BVH reader is defined in 
the class <b>ABVHReader</b> in <b>libsrc/animation/ABVHReader.cpp</b> 

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Question 5: Tentacle (12 points)</h3>
<hr>

<b>Part 1: Implement forward kinematics (5 points)</b>
<p>In this question, you will implement forward kinematics algorithm in
<b>ASkeleton::fk</b> and <b>AJoint::fk</b>.  

<p>Forward kinematics (FK) is the process of computing the global positions for
the end effectors. The basecode assumes that we will implement FK recursively,
starting at the root joint and then propagating down to each end effector (e.g.
hands, feet, head, tail, etc)

<pre>
AJoint::fk()
   if "I am the root joint"
	    compute local2global base case
	 else
	    compute local2global from parent

   call fk for each child
</pre>

<b>Part 2: Create a skeleton to represent the tentacle (2 points)</b>

<p>After implementing forward kinematics, you will have global positions and
rotations for each segment of the tentacle. This will allow us to draw the
tentacle using the following algorithm (note: this has been implemented for 
you)

<pre>
for each joint
   if the joint is the root
	     continue

   p1 = global position of the parent joint
   p2 = global position of the joint
   draw a limb between p1 and p2 
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Your skeleton should have at least 5 joints (including the root)
<li>Each joint is 50 units from its parent. To make this easier, let the offset of each joint from its parent by along the local X-axis. 
</ul>

<br>
<img src="tentacleSkeleton.png" height="320">
<br>

<b>Part 3: Animate the tentacle (5 points)</b>

<p>Use sine to animate each joint of the tentacle. 

<ul>
<li>Rotate each joint around its local Z axis.
<li>Use sine to compute the angle of rotation around each joint's local Z axis. 
<li>Offset the angle of rotation for each joint to make the animation more interesting 
</ul>

<!--
<p>When working, you can use the FKViewer to play animations from BVH files.
In our next assignment, we will look closely at how these motions are 
stored and played.

<p>To run the FKViewer from the <b>build</b> directory, type 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
build> ../bin/a6-fkviewer 
</pre>
</p>

<br>
<b>FKViewer user interface overview</b>
<br>

<p>When you open the viewer, it opens a character along with several example motions.

<p>The camera can be controled with the mouse:

<ul>
    <li>Left-button drag with the mouse to rotate
    <li>Right-button drag with the mouse to pan
    <li>Middle-button drag with the mouse to zoom
    <li>'f' button will focus the view on the character
</ul>

<p>The player control panel on the top left can be used to load and play files.
The panel at the bottom left can be used to load different BVH files.

<p>A pose of the character consists of a position for the root joint and rotations for 
each joint (in local coordinates). Each joint also has an offset from its parent, but these 
offsets are typically not animated. The framework stores poses in the class <b>APose</b>.

<p>Motion capture produces a sequence of poses at a fixed framerate, usually either 30 fps 
or 120 fps. The play an animation, we compute the pose for the given time, and then update 
the character skeleton with it. In the framework, <b>AMotion</b> is a subclass of 
<b>ASplines&lt;APose&gt;</b>. The function AMotion::getValue(time), computes the segment 
containing the given time and uses LERP and SLERP to compute the current pose.

<p>Motion capture animations are stored in BVH files and loaded with ABVHReader. BVH files 
specify the structure of the skeleton followed by a list of the poses. In the BVH file, each 
pose is the X Y Z of the root position followed by euler angles for each joint. 
BVH files can be found in <b>motions/Beta</b>.

<h3>Question 6: Thriller (10 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In the previous question, we had a single character. In this question, we will implement 
a troop of characters to perform thriller. We also randomize the characters to have different 
heights, sizes, and colors.
