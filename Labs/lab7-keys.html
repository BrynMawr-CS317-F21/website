<h1>CS56 Computer Animation: Lab 6</h1>
<div id="TagLine">
   In which, we build a simple keyframe editor
</div>
<hr>
     
<p>The goals of this lab are to 
<ul>
<li> Work with poses, skeletons, and transformations
<li> Create your own key frame editor and make a unique character animation 
</ul>

<br>

<video controls>
		<source src="keys.ogv">
</video>
</center>
<br>

<hr>
<h2>Get the source</h2>
<hr>

<p>The motion assignment has been added to your AnimationFramework repository.  To get the source, run

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
> cd cs56/AnimationToolkit 
> git pull
</pre>

<p>You should now have a new directory under assignments called a5-motion. 

<hr>
<h2>Compile and run</h2>
<hr>

<p>First, you will need to edit the CMakeLists.txt file under assignments to build the executables in the new directory, e.g. 

<pre>
add_subdirectory(viewer2d)
add_subdirectory(viewer3d)
add_subdirectory(a0-hello)
add_subdirectory(a1-a2-rotations)
add_subdirectory(a3-a4-curves)
add_subdirectory(a5-motion)
add_subdirectory(a6-keys)
</pre>

<p>Then, you can build and run like so

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
> cd AnimationFramework/build
> cmake ..
> make 
> ../bin/a6-keys
</pre>


<hr>
<h2>User interface overview</h2>
<hr>

<p>The basecode includes a simple interface and 3D viewer. See above for a demo. 

<p>The camera can be controled with the mouse:

<ul>
    <li>Left-button drag with the mouse to rotate
    <li>Right-button drag with the mouse to pan
    <li>Middle-button drag with the mouse to zoom
    <li>'f' button will focus the view on the character
</ul>

<p>The player control panel on the top left can be used to play/pause, step through keys, and see the simulation time.

<p>The key control panel on the bottom left can be used to manage and preview keys. 
<ul>
  <li><b>Key time</b> the current time used for adding, deleting, previewing, or editing keys
  <li><b>Delete key</b> Deletes the key corresponding to the current time. The viewer does not allow you to delete key 0. 
  <li><b>Set key</b> Allows you to add or edit keys, depending on whether a key exists for the current time or not.  
  If no key exists for the given key time, a new key is created. Otherwise, the existing key is modified with the current skeleton pose. 
  <li><b>Load saved keys</b>. The load button will load keysavefile.txt if one exists in the current running directory.
  <li><b>Save keys</b>. Saves the current list of keys to the file keysavefile.txt. This file is saved to the current running directory. 
  <li><b>Keys</b>. The list of keys. Clicking on items from this list with preview the key's pose on the skeleton and set the key time.
</ul>

<p>The edit pose panel on the right allows you to edit the skeleton's pose. The reset button sets the root position and all joint rotations 
to a default T-pose. Selecting a joint from the list will highlight it on the character and allow you to change its local rotation.

<h2>Lab exercise: Stacking Boxes</h2>
<hr>

<p>For this exercise, we will work in groups of 2-3 people. In your readme for this week, please include the member names of the people you worked with!

<p><p>A room has three boxes in it as shown below. Each box has a local coordinate system attached to it. The lengths of all three boxes
in the x,y, and z directions of their local coordinate frames are (3,2,1) respectively. The origin of each box is in the lower left-hand corner.
The z-axis of each box is aligned with the global Z axis.

<p>The position of B1 with respect to the world (e.g. coordinate system {X<sub>0</sub>,Y<sub>0</sub>,Z<sub>0</sub>}) is
<b>p<sub>1</sub></b> = [1 2 1]<sup>T</sup>.

<p>The position of B2 with respect to the world is <b>p<sub>2</sub></b> = [6 0 0]<sup>T</sup>.

<p>The position of B3 with respect to the world is <b>p<sub>3</sub></b> = [8 4 0]<sup>T</sup>.

<p>Furthermore, with respect to the world coordinate system, B2 has been rotated 45 degrees around Z<sub>0</sub> and
B3 has been rotated 90 degrees around Z<sub>0</sub>.

<p>It is desired to move B3 to the origin of the world coordinate system and neatly stack box B3 on top of B1.

<br>

<br>

<p>Your assignment implements the scene above. To run

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
> ../bin/a6-boxes
</pre>

<p>Open the file <b>AStackingBoxes.cpp</b>. This simple program implements the scene shown above. 

<ol>
   <li>(3 points) List the frames of reference F<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>, 
   F<sub>2</sub><sup>0</sup>, F<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> (in the form of homogeneous matrices) that describe the 
   position and orientations of boxes B1, B2, and B3 with respect to the world. Include your responses in your readmes for this week. Also, don't forget 
   to include your group member names in your readme.
   <li>(3 points) Implement the frames of reference from the previous question in AStackingBoxes::draw(). Your scene should now show the boxes in 
   their correct locations.
   <li>(1 points) What is the position of B2 relative to the local coordinate system attached to box B1? Express your answer as a displacement vector. 
   In your readme, work out the transformation (using F<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> notation above) and then implement it in 
   AStackingBoxes::draw to get your answer.  Look at the scene to check if your answer makes sense.
   <li>(1 points) What is the position of B3 relative to the local coordinate system attached to box B2? Express your answer as a displacement vector.
   In your readme, work out the transformation you need and then implement it in AStackingBoxes::draw to get your answer. Look at the scene to check if your 
   answer makes sense.
   <li>(2 points) What is the homogeneous transformation matrix that stacks B3 onto B1? In other words, what transformation F should we multiply to 
   <F<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> such that B3 sits on top of B1? In your readme, work out your transformation and then implement it to check your answer. 
   You can uncomment the draw code to see the location of your final box.
</ol>

<h2>Assignment <b>Due March 29</b></h2>
<hr>

<p>This is an individual assignment.

<p>In class, we talked about two ways of handling the timing of keyframes for splines. The first spline type maintains a 
list of keyframes that progress at a constant framerate. The animations based on motion capture 
(see the BVH files in /motions for examples) use this format. Your basecode 
implements a fixed framerate spline in the class AMotion and ASpline<T>. The second spline type maintains a 
list of <time, value> tuples. In this assignment, you will complete the implementation of this type of spline in <b>AKeySpline</b>. 

<p>For this assignment, all the code you need to edit is in the dirrectory <b>assignments/a6-keys</b>

<h3>AKeySpline</h3>

<p>Implement the following functions in <b>AKeySpline-basecode.cpp</b>. You may use ASpline.h as a reference but be mindful that 
your code needs to work with AKeyframe and support arbitrary timing! See the source for psuedocode for implementing each function.

<p><b>(10 points)</b> AKeySpline::applyPoseToSkeleton
<p><b>(10 points)</b> AKeySpline::getPoseFromSkeleton
<p><b>(5 points)</b> AKeySpline::getDuration
<p><b>(5 points)</b> AKeySpline::getNormalizedDuration
<p><b>(5 points)</b> AKeySpline::computeSegment
<p><b>(5 points)</b> AKeySpline::computeNormalizedTime
<p><b>(10 points)</b> AKeySpline::getValue

<h3>A simple animation</h3>

<p><b>(5 points)</b> Implement a simple march-in-place animation such as the following. 
Make a video and save your keyframes to a new file marchkeyframes.txt and include it with your submission.
