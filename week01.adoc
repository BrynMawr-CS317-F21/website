= From Java to C++

We will be using C++. If you're familiar with Java, C++ supports the same programming features as Java.

If you would like extra practice in C++, try the exercises from the following repository.

= Development environment

The primary goal of link:asst00.html[our first assignment] will be to setup our development environment. 

We will use link:https://git-scm.com/[git] for sharing source code and resources.

Our development environment is based on 

* link:https://cmake.org/[cmake]: generates build files for creating executables on linux, mac, and windows
* link:https://www.opengl.org/[openGL]: 3D drawing
* link:https://github.com/g-truc/glm[GLM]: math library

Everything will be setup in the Park Science Center labs (Rm 230 and Rm 231). You may want to setup your own laptop 
for development. Do it! It's a great idea. Make sure your code runs in the lab, however, for full credit on your assignments.

To setup your development environment on your own machine, use the instructions in the following repository:

= Introduction to animation

Animation is the illusion of movement created by showing a series of static images very quickly (think: flipbook). 

*Framerate*

The number of frames rendered (or displayed) each second. Typically measured in fps, or *frames per second*. 
For example, a framerate of 24 indicates that 24 frames are displayed each second. Conversely, the duration of 
each frame is 1/24.

*Procedural animation*

The animation is generated using an algorithm. Example might include a physical simulation or oscillating movement 
computed with sine and cosine. 

*Artist-driven animation*

The animation is created by an artists, typicly using a technique called *key-framing*. In a key-framed 
animation, the artist specifies the state of objects in the scene at different times. *Interpolation* is 
then used to transition smoothly between keys.

*Data-driven animation*

The animation is generated from a recording of movement. A popular example is optical motion capture, where 
reflective markers are used to keep track of the locations of different joints and landmarks on the body. 
This technique may also use *retargeting* to fit the recorded motion to a character with different proportions.
