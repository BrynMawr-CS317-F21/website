_In which, we build a curve editor for Catmull-Rom and Hermite splines_

**Due Friday, Oct 1, before midnight**
     
The goals of this lab are to 

* Implement Catmull-Rom splines
* Implement Hermite splines
* Implement an interactive spline editor

== User interface

The basecode includes a simple UI to help you test your splines. 

* Blue points represent the input data (aka keys) which are interpolated between. 
* Yellow points represent additional control points 

video::spline.ogv[width=600]

The UI panel contains widgets for

* *Type*: interpolation type (You will implement
Linear, Catmull-Rom, and Hermite 
* *Mode*: how left mouse clicks are interpreted: 
** *Add*: append points to the curve
** *Edit*: drag curve points (blue) and control points (yellow) using the
** *Delete*: remove curve points (blue) 
* *Ctrl pts*: toggle the display of control points (yellow)
* *Clear*: remove the entire curve.

== Implementation overview

Question: allow students to design their own, or give them a design? 
For this assignment you will implement 

= Get the source

On Github, do a `Fetch Upstream` to synchronize your forked repository with the class repository.

Then update the source on your local machine and rebuild.

[source]
----
> git pull
> cd build
> cmake ..; make
----

:sectnums:

= Linear splines 

Implement a spline capable of performing linear interpolation. 

TODO: Test program to ensure that it works

= Catmull-ROM splines 

Implement a Catmull-ROM spline using the formulation from class. 

*testCatmullRom.cpp* to check whether your implementation gives the same
results as our example from lab. 

To run your program from the *build* directory, type 

[source]
----
build> ../bin/a3-testCatmullRom 
----

= Hermite spline

Implement a Hermite spline using the formulation from class. 

*testHermite.cpp* to check whether your implementation gives the same
results as our example from lab. 

To run your program from the *build* directory, type 

[source]
----
build> ../bin/a3-testHermite 
----

= Curve editor

In the file *a3-splines/curveeditor.cpp*, complete the implementation 
of the curve editor. 

To run from the *build* directory, type 
[source]
----
build> ../bin/a3-curveeditor 
----

Features:

* Draw the curve in `todo`
* Add new data points in `todo`
* Delete data points in `todo`
* Edit the data points in `todo`
* Etc

= Be Unique!

Implement your own unique animation in *a3-splines/unique.cpp*. Below are some ideas:

* Implement a spline using a different interpolating curve
* Animate a character that has splines for limbs
* Use splines to animate shapes or create interesting patterns
