This worksheet is intended as a short 30 min exercise to be done in groups of 1-3 people.

= Stacking boxes

A room has three boxes in it. Each box has a local coordinate system
attached to it. The lengths of all three boxes in the x,y, and z directions of
their local coordinate frames are (3,2,1) respectively. The origin of each box
is in the lower left-hand corner.  The z-axis of each box is aligned with the
global Z axis.

* The position of B1 with respect to the world (e.g. the coordinate system corresponding to \(X_0, Y_0, Z_0 \)) is
\(p_1 = (-2, 0, 1)^T \).
* The position of B2 with respect to the world is \( p_2 = (4, 0, 2)^T \). The rotation of B2 with respect to the world is 45 degrees around the Z axis.
* The position of B3 with respect to the world is \( p_3 = (5, 4, 2)^T \). The rotation of B3 with respect to the world is 90 degrees around the Z axis.

In your assignment for this week, you will implement the solutions of the following questions. 
In this worksheet, you will manually solve for the transforms corresponding to the above picture. 

* What are the frames of reference -- \( F_1^0, F_2^0, F_3^0 \) -- in the form of 2x2 block matrices? Each matrix should transform from the block's local coordinate frame to the global coordinate frame.
