<h3>Question 1: Practice two-link chain analytical method (15 points)</h3>
<hr>

<p>In this question, you will work through the calculations needed to perform IK 
for a two-link chain on paper. Include your answers in your readme for this week. 
Remember that you can use python, octave, matlab, maple, our basecode or any other 
method to check your answers! 

<p>Suppose we have a 2-link chain as in class. 

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<p>The root joint p<sub>1</sub> is located at the origin.

<p>The next joint p<sub>2</sub> is offset from p<sub>1</sub> by (2,0,0)<sup>T</sup>

<p>The next joint p<sub>3</sub> is offset from p<sub>2</sub> by (5,0,0)<sup>T</sup>

<p><b>Solve using the analytic two-link method (Reference: <a href="../IK-Worksheet.html">here</a>)</b><br>

<li>Suppose we wish to position p<sub>3</sub> at a target position 
p<sub>d</sub> = (-4,3,0)<sup>T</sup>.  
Let's use the analytic IK method for class to 
compute rotations for p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub> such that 
p<sub>3</sub> is located at p<sub>d</sub>.
<ol>
<li><b>(1 point)</b> What is the desired distance r between p<sub>3</sub> and p<sub>1</sub>?
<li><b>(1 point)</b> What is L1?
<li><b>(1 point)</b> What is L2?
<li><b>(2 points)</b>What is the angle \( \theta_{2z}\) that achieves the desired length? 
<li><b>(1 points)</b>What is the new global position of joint 3? Verify that setting the rotation of joint 1 to \(\theta_{2z} \) results in the desired distance.
</ol>

<p>Using polar coordinates to compute the orientation of joint 1:
<ol>
<li><b>(1 points)</b> What is the angle \( \theta_{1z}\) that points the limb along the x axis? 
<li><b>(1 points)</b> What is the new global position of joint 3? Verify that setting \( \theta_{2z} \) and \( \theta_{1z} \) points the limb along the x axis using the kinematic equation for our joints. 
<li><b>(1 points)</b> Compute the heading (beta) and elevation (gamma) that point the limb towards the target \( p_d \).  
<li><b>(1 points)</b>Plug in beta, gamma, \( \theta_{1z} \), and \( \theta_{2z} \) and verify that \( p_3 \) is now at location \( p_d \).
</ol>

<p>Using angle/axis to compute the orientation of joint 1:
<ol>
<li><b>(1 points)</b>After setting the length, what is the global position of joint 3? 
<li><b>(1 points)</b>What is the direction vector r?
<li><b>(1 points)</b>What is the error vector e?
<li><b>(1 points)</b>What is the angle phi and axis of rotation?
<li><b>(1 points)</b>Plugin in the angle/axis rotation and \(\theta_{2z} \) and verify that \( p_3 \) is now at location \( p_d \)
</ol>
