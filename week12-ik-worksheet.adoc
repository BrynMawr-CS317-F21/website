= Two-link chain inverse kinematics

In this question, you will work through the calculations needed to perform IK 
for a two-link chain on paper. 

Remember that you can use python, octave, matlab, maple, our basecode or any other 
method to check your answers! 

Suppose we have a 2-link chain as in class.

* The root joint stem:[p_1] is located at the origin.
* The next joint stem:[p_2] is offset from stem:[p_1] by stem:[(2,0,0)^T]
* The next joint stem:[p_3] is offset from stem:[p_2] by stem:[(5,0,0)^T]

Reference: link:IK-Worksheet.html[IK example]

Suppose we wish to position stem:[p_3] at a target position stem:[p_d = (-4,3,0)^T]  

Let's use the analytic IK method for class to 
compute rotations for stem:[p_1] and stem:[p_2] such that 
stem:[p_3] is located at stem:[p_d].

* What is the desired distance r between stem:[p_3] and stem:[p_1]?

* Plug in stem:[\beta], stem:[\gamma], stem:[\theta_{1z}], and stem:[\theta_{2z}] and verify that stem:[p_3] is now at location stem:[p_d].
