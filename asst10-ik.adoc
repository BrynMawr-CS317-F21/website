_In which, we use inverse kinematics to animate our characters_

**Due Thursday, Dec 2, before midnight**
     
The goal of this lab is to 

* Implement two-link analytical and CCD algorithms on our character
* Implement procedural animations based on IK

= Get the source

On Github, do a `Fetch Upstream` to synchronize your forked repository with the class repository.

Then update the source on your local machine and rebuild.

[source]
----
> git pull
> cd build
> cmake ..; make

= Eye on the prize

In the file, `looker.cpp`, implement a character whose gaze follows a target. 

Your algorithm should align the forward direction of the head with the target. The forward
direction of the head is the Z axis (0,0,1) in its local coordinates.

To run the demo from the `build` directory, type

= Character IK

In the file, `ik_controller.cpp`, implement a poseable character using different algorithms.
This file implements a class which overrides `Skeleton` to support joints whose positions can be 
set using global coordinates. Inverse kinematics is used to calculate the corresponding local 
rotations of the interior joints.

The basecode comes with a viewer to help you test your algorithm.

User interface overview

The camera can be controlled with the mouse:

* Left-button drag with the mouse to rotate
* Right-button drag with the mouse to pan
* Middle-button drag with the mouse to zoom

The left frame lets you select joints, reset the pose, and set the goal position manually. 
The right panel lets you select the algorithm for IK along with IK parameters. For CCD:

* Threshold: how close to the goal do we need to be to stop iterating
* Max iterations: max number of iterations to use before stopping the algorithm
* Chain length: the number of ancestors to "nudge" towards the goal. If the chain size is -1, we use all ancestors up to (but excluding) the root.
* IK Algorithm: Either CCD or Analytic

== CCD 

Implement the CCD algorithm in `IKController::solveIKCCD()`.

[source]
----
// solveIKCCD positions the joint given by jointid so its global position
// is located at goalPos
//
// param skeleton: the character to modify
// param jointid: the ID of the joint to pose
// param goalPos: the target position for jointid (global pos)
// param chain: the list of joints to "nudge" towards the goal
// param threshold: when the given joint is within threshold of the goal, stop iterating
// param maxIters: the max number of iterations to try to reach the goal
// 
// return true/false based on whether we could reach the goal
// side effect: skeleton should by posed such that jointid is located at goalPos (or in this direction of 
// goalPos if the target is out of reach) 
bool IKController::solveIKCCD(Skeleton& skeleton, int jointid,
    const AVector3& goalPos, std::vector<Joint*> chain, float threshold, int maxIters)

To run the demo from the `build` directory, type 

[source]
----
build> ../bin/a10-ik

NOTE: When you change the local rotation of a joint, you must call fk() to update the global rotations and translations.

Implementation Hints

* When implementing CCD, make the chain length 1 to start and ensure that a single joint can follow the target. 
* Test in your function that your angle/axis computation is correct by computing whether the computed rotation indeed rotates the limb towards the target. 
* Then, make sure that you can set the rotation matrix correctly in the joint's local coordinate system.

== Analytical method

Implement `IKController::solveIKAnalytic()`. Your solution should combine the 
techniques of the simple two-link analytic approach with CCD's angle/axis calculation. This work 
will allow us to animate the legs and arms of the character such that the knees and elbows 
bend along their natural axis. 

[source]
----
// solveIKAnalytic: positions the joint given by jointid so its global position
// is located at goalPos. This method computes rotations for the parent and grandparent 
// of jointid.
//
// param skeleton: the character to modify
// param jointid: the ID of the end effector
// param goalPos: the target position for jointid (global pos)
// 
// return true/false based on whether we could reach the goal
// side effect: skeleton should by posed such that jointid is located at goalPos (or in this direction of 
// goalPos if the target is out of reach) 
bool IKController::solveIKAnalytic(Skeleton& skeleton, int jointid, const vec3& goalPos)
----

To run the demo from the `build` directory, type 

[source]
----
build> ../bin/a10-ik 
----

Implementation hints:

* Use the angle/axis CCD computation to solve for the grandparent joint rotation. 
* Use the law of cosines to solve for the parent joint rotation. 
* Use the follow axis formula to choose the axis of rotation for the parent joint:

[source]
----
vec3 limbDir = normalize(parentJoint->getLocalTranslation());
vec3 axis = cross(limbDir, vec3(0,0,-1));
if (limbDir[1] < 0) axis = cross(limbDir, vec3(0,0,1)); 
----

= Dancer 

In the file `dancer.cpp`, implement a procedural algorithm to make our character dance. 
Your solution should animate the positions of the hands and hips to move up and down 
(for example, using sine or cosine). Use IK to keep the feet planted on the ground. Use 
IK to compute the elbow and shoulder positions given the position of the hands. 
You can choose to use either solveIKAnalytic or solveIKCCD.

Your solution will modify the motion in idle.bvh to make the hands and hips move differently.

To run the demo from the `build` directory, type 

[source]
----
build> ../bin/a10-dancer
----

Demo requirements

* You should animate the hips back and forth and up and down. 
* You should animate the hands up and down. 
* The feet should not move
* Note: You may use either sine/cosine or a spline to animate the hips and hands. 

Suggested approach

1) Animate the hand targets first.

image::Lab/dancer1.gif[]

2) Then use IKController to position the hands so that they follow the targets 

image::Labs/dancer2.gif[]

3) Then animate the position of the hips 

image::Labs/dancer3.gif[]

4) Then pin the feet to their original position using IKController

5) Then reset the rotation of the feet to their original global rotation

= Unique

Personalize one the demos from this assignment. Below are some ideas:

* Make you own unique animation based on inverse kinematics, splines, and motions.  For example, make a new dance, have the character hold a
cup, or wave. 
* Try your procedural dance or look on an other motions.
* Try creating a procedural walker by using IK on the legs. 
* Create a procedural motion for an animal or insect, such as a spider, centipede, cat, ostrich, or fish. 
* Create a unique looking character or environment.
